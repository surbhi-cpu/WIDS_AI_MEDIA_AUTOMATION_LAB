# WIDS_AI_MEDIA_AUTOMATION_LAB
My work under AI media automation lab WIDS project. As part of this project , we are making an agentic A.I. which can produce video social media and upload it without human intervention including the scripting , sunds , video content and automatic uploads of the content. We would use Crewai and LLMs to achieve this. I have decided to use groq for this. I am also making an Agentic A.I. which can help in pre-reg in IITB by selecting courses based on the persons slots , grading stats of the course and the individual's prefrence of the department , types of course, ourseload and cpi vs interest tradeoff as an individual project. As of 7/1/2025 I have spent time understanding the crewai's framework and workings. I have built some simple agentic AI to test the crewai and my understanding and learn troubleshooting. At first, I was using GEMINI as my llm but it was not working properly so I have decided to use groq instead
